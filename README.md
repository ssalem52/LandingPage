This is the second project in the Udacity Front-End Web Development NanoDegree. This project concludes course 2 called Javascript and the DOM. The project requires students to build a multi-section landing page using javascript, html and css.

It also requires using javascript to smooth scroll to the section from clicking the link in the menubar and, detect and set the active section by modifying the css classes.
